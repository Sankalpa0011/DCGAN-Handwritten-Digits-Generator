# DCGAN Handwritten Digits Generator
---

This repository contains an implementation of a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** to generate handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The project showcases how GANs can be used for creative tasks like image synthesis.

## Features

- Implements a DCGAN to generate realistic handwritten digit images.
- Trains the GAN using the MNIST dataset.
- Includes model visualization, training progress tracking, and generated outputs.
- Saves trained models for further usage or evaluation.

## Requirements

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dcgan-handwritten-digits.git
   cd dcgan-handwritten-digits
   ```

2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python DCGAN_Handwritten_Digits_Generator.ipynb
   ```

   This will train the DCGAN on the MNIST dataset and generate samples during the training process.

3. Generated images and saved models will be stored in the output directory.

## Project Structure

- `DCGAN_Handwritten_Digits_Generator.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the implementation and training process.
- `outputs/`: Directory for storing generated images and trained model weights.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Highlights

- **Training**: The GAN learns to generate digit-like images through adversarial learning between the generator and discriminator networks.
- **Visualization**: The training process includes visualizing generated samples at different epochs.
- **Model Saving**: Trained models are saved for reuse or evaluation.

## Examples

### Generated Digits
Below are examples of images generated by the DCGAN after training:

## How It Works

### GAN Architecture
The DCGAN consists of:
- **Generator**: Produces fake handwritten digits from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: Classifies images as real (from dataset) or fake (from generator).
- **Loss Function**: The GAN uses adversarial loss to optimize both networks.

### Dataset
- The GAN is trained on the MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 handwritten digit images.
